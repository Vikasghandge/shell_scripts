📧 Final Resignation Email

Subject: Resignation from the Position of Software Developer

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to formally resign from my position as Software Developer at Arcon, effective [your last working date – as per notice period].

Over the past few months, I’ve had the opportunity to learn and contribute in different areas, and I’m truly thankful for the exposure and support I’ve received. However, after careful thought, I’ve realized that my current role is not fully aligned with my long-term career path and technical expertise.

Additionally, since moving to Mumbai, I’ve been facing some health-related issues, and I believe it’s best for me to take some time to recover and refocus on my overall well-being.

This decision was not easy, but I believe it’s the right step toward continuing my growth and maintaining my health. I kindly request you to please release me as soon as possible, if feasible, as that would greatly help me focus on my recovery and future plans.

I am committed to ensuring a smooth handover of my work during my notice period.
I also request you to kindly confirm the process for my relieving letter, experience certificate, and final settlement.

Thank you once again for the understanding, support, and learning opportunities provided during my tenure.

Warm regards,
Vikas Ghandge
